Mapping Wealth
==============

IRS wealth data mapped over 20 years

This is a proof-of-concept for an interactive visualization that never made it to public release. Posted for posterity and maybe future hacking!

Demo
----

This [demo](http://assets.sunlightlabs.com.s3.amazonaws.com/mapping_wealth/choropleth.html) should be functional.

Data
----
Data was originally obtained, for a fee, from the [IRS Statistics of Income](http://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-Statistics-of-Income) program.

This data (or possibly similar data) now appears to be [freely available](http://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-County-Data)
